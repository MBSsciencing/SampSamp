-- Requires Windows 10 and at least MATLAB 2021a --

SAMPSAMP is a data acquisition program that connects to National Instruments (NI) hardware, recording and displaying data in real-time in conjunction with a photo-diode light based trigger.

To run this program you will either need a full liscence of MATLAB or MATLAB runtime, with the Data Acquisition (DAQ) Toolbox installed.

The gui can be opened by running 'sampsamp' in the Command Window. 

Version History:

-----2.1 FORK (MBSsciencing) ----
* Changes to GUIDE to make trigoff on startup, and default save location a file on C drive (previously Yuri U drive) 
* Changes to .m file to force handle update so trig off is forced. Without those changes, sampsamp will continue to save data but will not plot photodiode or data unless you toggle trig on and off again. 
 

--- 2.1 ---
* Added a conversion script that converts the data output from SampSamp into a format useable by LabView
* Fixed issue with saving timestamps in incorrect format
* Fixed potential issue with 'dir' being used as variable name
* Added version info and sampling rate used to data output 

--- 2.0 ---
* Full update of SampSamp backend to bring it from Matlab 2009 to Matlab 2024b
* Added new parameter to edit the max size of a data block before a new one is created, improving stability of recording
* Handling of DAQ changed to instead use a FIFO buffer to optimise code and reduce risk of crash during recording
* How 'No Trigger' option saves data is changed to instead create new data blocks over time instead of one giant block
* Removed reduntant GUI features that had no code written for them to reduce clutter
